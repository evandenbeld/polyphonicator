# polyphonicator
Arduino converter for midi to 4 channel polyphonic control voltages. 

- 4x Note CV output (88 keys, 1V/octave) using a 12-bit DAC
- 4x Gate output (5V when specific note played)
- 1x Gate output (5V when any note played)

Loosely based on [midi2cv](https://github.com/elkayem/midi2cv/) by Larry McGovern.
